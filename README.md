A project that uses Blazor to query the OMDb API to retrieve movie data based off the movie's name, year and IMDb ID. https://www.omdbapi.com/

This project uses Blazor Bootstrap for components: https://demos.blazorbootstrap.com/

I have added the simple functionality but would like to add tests and create a more visually pleasing layout.
